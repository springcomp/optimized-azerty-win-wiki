In some applications, some keyboard shortcuts no longer work with the AZERTY-NF layout.

Most Windows applications rely on a combination of the _virtual key code_ and modifiers (<kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd> or <kbd>AltGr</kbd>) to detect the keyboard shortcut being typed. By modifying the location of certain characters, the AZERTY-NF layout breaks keyboard shortcuts in some applications.

Furthermore, the AZERTY-NF introduces an extensive set of new diacriticals implemented in the form of _dead keys_. Keyboard shortcuts that relied on combinations that were not mapped in the traditional AZERTY layout may be broken as a result.

This page lists known applications and the broken keyboard shortcuts.

## Google Sheets

The following keyboard shortcuts no longer work:

- Paste format only: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd>.

**Solution**: please, use the `Edit | Paste special | Paste format only` menu item instead.

## Microsoft Office

In most Office apps, it is impossible to type an `_` (underscore) character in the _backstage_ area.

For instance. in the `Save As` screen, it is impossible to type an `_` when typing the new name under which the document must be saved as because it conflicts with the <kbd>AltGr</kbd>+<kbd>8</kbd> keyboard shortcut.

**Solution**: please, take advantage of the numeric keypad and punch in the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd><kbd>9</kbd><kbd>5</kbd> [Alt code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_code) instead.
